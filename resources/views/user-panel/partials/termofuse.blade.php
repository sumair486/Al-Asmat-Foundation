							The emergency funds which we have generated for Smile Charity would be utilized either on the emergency cases or on those patients whose surgery has been done and due to some complication during the operation more money is required. We apprehend that there might be various forms of complexities during the surgical treatment of any patient and the lack of funds should not become an obstacle in treating the patient. Hence, the emergency funds will always be there to help in completing the process till the patient is fully recovered.
						</li>

						<li>
							We only publish the approximate required amount for surgery. The amount may vary according to the condition of a patient during the surgery.
