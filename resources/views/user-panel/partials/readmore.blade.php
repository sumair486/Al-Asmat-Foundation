							WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?
						</h3>

						<p>
							More than 80 million people in Pakistan are living below the poverty line due to which they are unable to undergo proper health treatment if they suffer from any disease. Estimated number of surgery backlog in Pakistan is in millions every year.
						</p>

						<ul class="privacy">
							<li>
								There are not many health insurance plans for underprivileged community due to which, majority of the people are unable to undergo medical or surgical treatment.
							</li>

							<li>
								Beyond the cost of medical and surgical procedures, they have to pay for other expenses such as pre and post-operative expenses which include; medical tests, medications and hospital stay. It is almost impossible for someone who earns less than $2 a day to pay hefty amount for medical relief.
							</li>

							<li>
								There is lack of medical facilities and medical professionals in rural areas across Pakistan due to which, poverty-stricken families are unable to avail required treatment.
							</li>

							<li>
								There are a limited number of beds in local hospitals which are not enough to cater to the healthcare needs of underprivileged community.
